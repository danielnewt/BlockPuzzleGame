This project was created an completed by Daniel Newton.

The idea was to make a game that uses a similar perspective and control to the 2D Legend of Zelda games.

The object of the game is to push the blocks out of your way so that you can reach the end of the level.
Blocks can only be pushed once.
If the player get stuck they can use the pause menu to restart the level.
